# platform-initiative

The Creative Commons platform initiative works to grow the commons and build a movement by creating easy, clear, and enjoyable ways for users to contribute to the commons. CC will partner with platforms to: research the impact CC licenses have for users; increase CC visibility and education on platforms; increase community engagement with the commons; solve legal problems that inhibit the free flow of content and sharing on and across platforms; improve the technical discovery and reuse capabilities of platforms; and increase platformsâ€™ understanding of CC through concrete value propositions. Additionally, CC will explore enhancing current products or developing new ones and new revenue models that might arise from platform partnerships.
