# platform-initiative

The Creative Commons platform initiative works to grow the commons and build a movement by creating easy, clear, and enjoyable ways for users to contribute to the commons. CC will partner with platforms to: research the impact CC licenses have for users; increase CC visibility and education on platforms; increase community engagement with the commons; solve legal problems that inhibit the free flow of content and sharing on and across platforms; improve the technical discovery and reuse capabilities of platforms; and increase platforms’ understanding of CC through concrete value propositions. Additionally, CC will explore enhancing current products or developing new ones and new revenue models that might arise from platform partnerships. 

For full details, see the wiki starting with our [Theory of Change](https://github.com/creativecommons/platform-initiative/wiki/0:--Theory-of-Change) WRT platforms.

## Areas of Expertise

Expertise among staff and advisors falls into the following areas:

| Area | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Business development | responsible for getting in front of people who make decisions about product at platforms, promoting CC at events, building relationships, and community outreach. |
| Community engagement | responsible for thinking about the 1 or 2 things we can do with a platform to increase user engagement with the commons, better connect creators and users, and develop collaborations between platforms with similar goals. |
| Legal expertise | responsible for interfacing with the platform’s counsel, reviewing TOS, exploring new legal tools for platforms, addressing trademark violations, navigating tricky copyright situations, and developing legal resources for platforms. |
| Tech and UI implementations expertise | responsible for interfacing with platform’s developers, updating chooser code, mocking up simple visual examples as needed, and creating a developers toolkit that includes a model platform, resizable logos, visual examples/mock-ups, and updated web integration HOWTO’s. |
| Research | responsible for exploring research opportunities with platforms, defining metrics, and surveying (and possibly contributing to) the landscape for research highlighting the social and/or economic value of the commons. |
| Sustainability | responsible for leading thinking around how platform partnerships can lead to new funding opportunities for CC, legal and business services CC could charge for via a subsidiary, and how CC can be integrated into a platform’s business model. |
| Communications | responsible for press announcements about major platform adoptions, including platform agenda into major news stories about CC, and updating SOTC with relevant platform metrics. |
| Program-specific expertise | responsible for advising on platforms in those domains, especially regarding urgent opportunities that arise within domain-specific movements. |

## Workflow
1. Staff makes contact with platform. Staff adds contact and meeting details to CC Platform Engagements (MASTER) list and emails Driver with responses to Part One of the [Threshold/Guiding Questions](https://github.com/creativecommons/platform-initiative/wiki/5:--Threshold-&-Guiding-Questions). 
1. Driver gauges priority according to Threshold questions. If priority platform, Driver has quick meeting with staff member for more info, pulls in relevant staff to think through engagement, and outlines next steps for outreach. If not priority, Driver tells staff member and adoption is added as a GitHub issue to queue; staff member is assigned to lead platform adoption and pull in relevant staff to assist, updating the Master list and copying Driver with major developments. 
1. For priority adoptions, cycle will likely go something like this: Business Development meetings → Legal and Tech UI review → Meetings with counsel/tech if necessary → Circle back with platform work product team → CC adopted → Communications announcing adoption
1. For platform partnerships that involve a community engagement, research, sustainability, or policy campaign piece, more heavy lifting may be required and depending on urgency of activity, all hands on deck.
